# Seamless Event Access 🎟️

A Mediatech / EventTech UX prototype focused on creating a frictionless event journey — from ticket booking to on-ground entry — using minimal steps and QR-based verification.

This project demonstrates how event access can be made fast, predictable, and scalable for high-crowd environments.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Most event experiences fail due to:
- Multiple verification steps
- Manual checks at entry points
- Poor coordination between booking and access systems

This project solves that by designing a **single, continuous flow** where:
> One ticket = one identity = instant entry

---

## 🚀 Solution Overview

The system provides a **mobile-first user journey** covering:

1. Event discovery
2. Quick booking with OTP verification
3. QR-based ticket generation
4. Automated event reminders
5. Fast QR scanning at entry gates

No printing.  
No manual validation.  
No confusion.

## 📱 User Flow

**Events → Book → Ticket → Reminder → Entry**

Each step is optimized for:
- Minimal user input
- High visibility in crowded environments
- Fast decision-making by staff and attendees

---

## 🧩 Key Screens Designed

- **Event Listing Screen** – Browse and select events
- **Quick Booking Screen** – Phone/email + OTP verification
- **Ticket Screen** – Auto-generated QR code
- **Reminder Screen** – Entry gate and instructions
- **Entry Scanner Screen (Staff View)** – Real-time QR validation

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Figma** – UI/UX design and prototyping
- **Mobile-first design principles**
- **QR-based access logic (conceptual)**

> Note: This repository focuses on UX and system flow, not backend implementation.
